Overview
============
**Mpl-style** is a Python package, which allows **matplotlib** users to improve the quality of their plots. The core of **mpl-style** is a **PLT-base** class contained list of functions, which change initial settings of **matplotlib**. Figure 1 illustrates these changes by plotting several trigonometric functions with and without **PLT-base**.

In addition, with **mpl-style** a new class based on **PLT-base** can be created. Class, which keeps your own plot style, will save your time in the future and reduce amount of strings in your code needed for improving.
