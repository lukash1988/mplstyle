Features
--------
* ficus is a (mixed integer) linear programming model for multi-commodity energy systems.
* It finds the minimum cost energy system to satisfy given demand time-series for possibly multiple commodities (e.g. electricity, heat)
* It considers given cost time-series for external obtained commodities as well as peak demand charges with configurable timebase for each commodity
* It allows to deactivate specific equations, so the model becomes a linear programming model without integer variables
* It supports multiple-input and multiple-output energy conversion technologies with load dependent efficiencies
* ficus includes reporting and plotting functions

Installation
------------
If you don't already have an existing Python I recommend using the Python distribution Anaconda. It contains all needed packages except Pyomo. 

1.	`Anaconda`_ (Python 2.7 or Python 3.5). Choose the 64-bit installer if possible. During the installation procedure, keep both checkboxes "modify PATH" and "register Python" selected!
2. `Pyomo`_ (pip install pyomo)	
3. `download`_ or clone (with `git`_) this repository to a directory of your choice.
4. Copy the ``ficus.py`` file to a directory which is already in python's search path or add the ``python`` folder to python's search path (sys.path) (`how to`__)
5.	Install a :ref:`solver <solver-ref>` (optional).

Get started
------------
1.	:ref:`Run <run_ficus>` the given examples in the `examples` folder.
2.	Follow the :ref:`turorial <tutorial>` to create your own input file.

Solver
-----------

Pyomo allows using the `NEOS Server for Optimization`_ for solving, so it is **not required to install a solver**.

I still recommend to install and use one of the following solvers.

  1. **GLPK** (open source)
       1. Download the latest version (e.g. GLPK-4.55) of `WinGLPK`_
       2. Extract the contents to a folder, e.g. `C:\GLPK`
       3. Add the sub-folder `w64` to your system path, e.g. `C:\GLPK\w64` (`how`_).
  2. **CPLEX** (commercial)
  
       Download and install IBM's `CPLEX <http://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/>`_ solver. (`Free for academics <https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/cplex_studio_in_ibm_academic_initiative?lang=en>`_)
  3. **Gurobi** (commercial)

       Download and install `Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com/>`_ solver. (`Free for academics <http://www.gurobi.com/academia/for-universities>`_)
