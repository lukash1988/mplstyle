Examples
========

In the ``examples`` folder several examples of input files are given. This section gives a short description of the examples.


example.xls and example_from_excel.xlsm
----------------------------------------

The input file ``example.xls`` and ``example_from_excel.xlsm`` are used within the :ref:`tutorial <create-input-ref>` explaining how to create an own input file by editing a given one.

The factory described in this example has given demand time-series for electricity (*elec*) and *heat*, that have to be covered. While *elec* can be imported and exported, *heat* has to be produced inside the factory. Therefore an electric heater, a gas boiler and/or chp unit can be used. Since the chp and the gas boiler require *gas* as an input, *gas* can be imported as well. To model a *pv* system, the intermittend supply time-series *solar* is given. Additionally a battery storage for *elec* and a heat storage for *heat* are defined.

The processed chp, booiler and el. heater have given installed capaities that can not be expanded any more. Only the process pv and the battery and heat storage can be built. The result of this model will be an optimal cpacity expansion of this three technologies and an optimal operation of all defined and built processes and storages.

cover_heat+elec_xxx.xls
----------------------------------------

The input files ``cover_heat+elec_automotive.xls``, ``cover_heat+elec_carbon.xls``, ``cover_heat+elec_iron.xls`` and ``cover_heat+elec_steel.xls`` all have the same structure of defined commodities, processes and storages. But each factory has different demand time-series for electricity and heat. Since the time-series are given in a 15-minute resolution for one year, solving these problems might take a few hours (depending on the use solver).

The factories described in this example have given demand time-series for electricity (*elec*) and *heat*, that have to be covered. While *elec* can be imported and exported, *heat* has to be produced inside the factory. Therefore an immersion heater (im heater), a gas boiler and/or chp unit can be used. Since the chp and the gas boiler require *gas* as an input, *gas* can be imported as well. To model capacity specific investment costs, several chp units with different investment costs and different minimum new capacities are defined. Additionally three battery storages, *RedoxFlow*, Li-Ionen-1C* and *Li-Ionen-2C* for the commodity *elec* and a heat storage *TES* for *heat* are defined.

In these examples no processes and storages have installed capacities. The result of this model will be an optimal cpacity expansion and operation of all defined and built processes and storages. For importimg electricity here time-sensitive prices are used.

steel_mill_example.xls
----------------------------------------

The factory described in this example describes an examplary steel mill. The steel mill has given demand time-series for electricity (*elec*), *heat* and *steel*, that have to be covered. While *elec* can be imported and exported, *heat* and *steel* have to be produced inside the factory. 

For producing *heat* an immersion heater (im heater), a gas boiler and/or chp unit can be used. Since the chp and the gas boiler require *gas* as an input, *gas* can be imported as well. Both processes also are defined to produce *CO2* as an output commodity. Since the produced *CO2* has to be "used" somewhere, it is defined as an export commodity. By defining negative costs for exporting *CO2*, cost for *CO2* production is applyed here.

A battery storage for *elec* and a heat storage for *heat* are defined.

For producing steel, a electric arc furnace is defined. It consumes *iron*, which can be imported and *elec* to produce steel. Since there is a demand for *steel* only at the end of each working day, the steel could either produced at exactly at this time, or it can be produced during the whole day and stored in the defined stock. This leads to a smaller capacity of the furnace.

Additionally a battery storage for *elec* and a heat storage for *heat* are defined.

In these examples no processes and storages have installed capacities. The result of this model will be an optimal cpacity expansion and operation of all defined and built processes and storages. For importimg electricity here time-sensitive prices are used.
